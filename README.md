# DirectoryEncoderSample
Sample gulp build for Directory Encoder with sample usage

Directory Encoder is used to encode assets such as SVGs or PNGs into CSS for use in HTML markup. It is the base library used in Grunticon (see https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon)

The focus of this example is the gulpfile.js. Start there to see how things fit together.

See https://github.com/filamentgroup/directory-encoder for options usage.
